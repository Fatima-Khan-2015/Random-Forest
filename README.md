# Random-Forest
This repository demonstrates the implementation and working of the Random Forest algorithm, a popular ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. Random Forest builds multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions to improve accuracy, reduce variance, and prevent overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

The notebook covers:

Concept of Random Forest: How bootstrapping and feature randomness create diverse decision trees.

Training process: Building multiple trees and aggregating results through majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression).

Python implementation using scikit-learn with examples on sample datasets.

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Visualization of feature importance to identify which variables contribute most to predictions.

The implementation leverages scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for model building, data processing, and visualization. By experimenting with hyperparameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and feature splits, users can observe how Random Forest balances bias and variance for improved performance.

This project is ideal for learners exploring ensemble methods and understanding why Random Forest is widely applied in domains like finance, healthcare, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.
